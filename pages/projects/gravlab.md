# Gravity Research

Of all the fundamental forces, gravity is the weakest.  This makes it difficult to study it's behavior in many circumstances.  The [Humboldt State Gravitational Research Lab](http://www.humboldt.edu/physics/gravitational-lab.html) is developing a null experiment that aims to observe the [Weak Equivalence Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) between objects separated by distances less than 50 microns.  At a minimum, the experiment will confirm the WEP at previously unexplored distances.  More interestingly, it may lead to insights about Dark Energy or possibly undiscovered fundamental forces if the WEP is observed to break down at these short distance scales.

My contribution to the project focused on precisions motion encoding and positioning, and developing the custom data collection software.
