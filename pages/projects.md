Projects
===========

This is a list of personal projects that I have worked on over the past few years.  I am actively writing it over the next day or so.  Expect broken links and draft level grammar and spelling.

##[SEMterface (2013 - Present)](/pages/projects/semterface) 
* I'm putting a Scanning Electron Microscope onto the internet using [websockets](http://socket.io), [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) and [node](http://nodejs.org/) for great good and a masters degree in applied physics.

##This website (2012 - Present)
* This website has turned into somewhat of a project itself.  It's built with jekyll and incorporates some [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) building blocks.  I am currently working on the next version using node.

##VPS/Personal Cloud
* After relying upon shell accounts living on friends servers for a while, I decided to start running my own for various 'cloud' services.  It is likely also the future home of the revamped website.

##[Webmention.js (2013)](https://github.com/bcomnes/webmention.js)
* This small client side javascript library makes it easy to display webmention data from the [webmention.io]() service.

##[Homework Template (2012 - 2013)](https://github.com/bcomnes/hw-template)
* This is the template I use to write up homework in grad school.  It's a collection of packages and templates that I found useful for typing quantum and electricity and magnetism physics problems.

##[LaTeX Font Sizing in TextMate 2](https://github.com/bcomnes/LaTeX-Section-Font-Sizes.tmbundle)
* A small bundle that resizes the section names in LaTeX documents so that they are easier and faster to identify.

## Mathematica Notebooks
Gifs Coming Soon!

* [Ising Model]():
* [Hydrogen Atom Energy Levels](): 
* [Where's Waldo]():
* [Tricky E&M Integrals]():
* [Fun Calculus Problems]():

## Introductory Physics Labs
* I wrote two labs for an introductory electronics class at Portland State University.
  - [Microcontroller Lab](https://github.com/bcomnes/315-lab-microcontroller): This lab introduces students to microcontrollers by walking them through a variety of activities using the Arduino Microcontroller.  It also includes a small section on use of the [PID]() Arduino library.  
  - [FPGA Lab](https://github.com/bcomnes/fpga-lab): This lab introduces [FPGAs]() using the Diligent Nexus 3 FPGA and the Xilinx ISE IDE.  
  - [LabVIEW Examples](https://github.com/bcomnes/labview-tutorials): A collection of common design patterns in LabVIEW that I found myself needing to reference when teaching others. 

## [Gravity Research](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627758235393/)
- Interferometer
- Capacitive Sensing
- Instrumentation
- Data collection Software
    
  
## Senior Labs
One week to work on a lab and write it up.  Here are the results.

## [445nm Lasers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157624743491759/)

## [Arduino Microserver](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627731812031/)

## [Longhaul Trucker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627731825277/)

## [Discovering Galaxies at NAIC Arecibo Observatory](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157622851001054/)
AKA The worlds (now former) largest radio telescope.  

## [Photos](http://flickr.com/photos/bretc/)
I liked taking pictures, but sadly, my camera fell and broke in 2011, so I'm stuck shooting with a cell phone.  Also, flickr is really starting to be awful.
