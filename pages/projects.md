Projects
===========

This is a list of personal projects from the past few years.  This page is being actively written it over the next day or so.  Expect broken links and draft level grammar and spelling.

##[SEMterface (2013 - Present)](/pages/projects/semterface) 
* SEMterface aims to put a Scanning Electron Microscope onto the Internet using [websockets](http://socket.io), [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) and [node](http://nodejs.org/) for great good and earn me a masters degree in applied physics.

##This website (2012 - Present)
* This website has turned into somewhat of a project itself.  It's built with jekyll and incorporates some [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) building blocks.  The next version is built with node and is in active development.

##VPS/Personal Cloud
* Having a computer that is always on and perpetually connected to the Internet opens up a lot of possibilities and turns out to be a lot of fun.  Some services that can run on such a personal server are more useful than others, and these are some notes on my experience with a variety of tools.

##[Webmention.js (2013)](https://github.com/bcomnes/webmention.js)
* This small client side javascript library makes it easy to display webmentions and pingback data from the [webmention.io](http://webmention.io/) service.

##[Homework Template (2012 - 2013)](https://github.com/bcomnes/hw-template)
* Having the right packages and templates can make the difference between hating and loving LaTeX.  This collection makes writing Quantum Mechanics and E&M homework a bit quicker and neater.

##[LaTeX Font Sizing in TextMate 2](https://github.com/bcomnes/LaTeX-Section-Font-Sizes.tmbundle)
* A small bundle that resizes the section names in LaTeX documents so that they are easier and faster to identify.

## [Resume](/assets/resume/Bret_Comnes_CV_Public.pdf)
* My resume typeset in LaTeX and tracked on [github](https://github.com/bcomnes/Resume).
* Check out the comments in the [.tex](https://github.com/bcomnes/Resume/blob/public/resume.tex) file for more details.
* LaTeX is great when it comes to printing Resumes but an HTML version is looking more and more attractive lately.

## Introductory Physics Labs
These two labs and LabVIEW design patterns were written for an introductory electronics class at Portland State University.  Some were written in .DOCX format at the request of the instructor.

- [Microcontroller Lab](https://github.com/bcomnes/315-lab-microcontroller) -  This lab introduces students to microcontrollers by walking them through a variety of activities using the Arduino Microcontroller.  It also includes an additional section on use of the [PID](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary) Arduino library.

## Senior Labs
One week to work on a lab and write it up.  Here are the results.

## [445nm Lasers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157624743491759/)

## [Arduino Microserver](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627731812031/)

## [Longhaul Trucker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627731825277/)

## [Discovering Galaxies at NAIC Arecibo Observatory](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157622851001054/)
AKA The worlds (now former) largest radio telescope.  

## [Photos](http://flickr.com/photos/bretc/)
I liked taking pictures, but sadly, my camera fell and broke in 2011, so I'm stuck shooting with a cell phone.  Also, flickr is really starting to be awful.
