Projects
===========

This is a list of personal projects that I have worked on over the past few years.  I am actively writing it over the next day or so.  Expect broken links and draft level grammar and spelling.

##[SEMterface (2013 - Present)](/pages/projects/semterface) 
* I'm putting a Scanning Electron Microscope onto the internet using [websockets](http://socket.io), [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) and [node](http://nodejs.org/) for great good and a masters degree in applied physics.

##[This website (2012 - Present)]()
* This website has turned into somewhat of a project itself.  It's built with jekyll and incorporates some [indieweb]() building blocks.

##[The next version of this website (2013 - Present)]()
- Jekyll was fun, but static sites are a bit too limiting with what I want to achieve.  The next version of this site is being built in node on top of the express web framework.

##[Personal Cloud/VPN]()
* After relying upon shell accounts living on friends servers for a while, I decided to start running my own for various 'cloud' services.  It is likely also the future home of the revamped website.

##[Webmention.js (2013)]()
* This small client side javascript library makes it easy to display webmention data from the [webmention.io]() service.

##[Homework Template (2012 - 2013)]()
* This is the template I use to write up homework in grad school.  It's a collection of packages and templates that I found useful for typing quantum and electricity and magnatism physics problems.
  - [Example 1]()
  - [Example 2]()
  - [Example 3]()
  - (Some of the solutions are wrong.  You have been warned!)

##[LaTeX Font Sizing in TextMate 2]()
* A small bundle that resizes the section names in LaTeX documents so that they are easier to identify.

## [Mathematica Notebooks]()
* [Ising Model]():
* [Hydrogen Atom Energy Levels](): 
* [Where's Waldo]():
* [Tricky E&M Integrals]():
* [Fun Calculus Problems]():

## [Resume]()
* My resume typeset in LaTeX and versioned with git.

## [Introductory Physics Labs]()
* I wrote two labs for an introductory electronics class at Portland State University.
  - [Microcontroller Lab](): This lab introduces students to microcontrollers by walking them through a variety of activities using the Arduino Microcontroller.  It also includes a small section on use of the [PID]() Arduino library.  
  - [FPGA Lab](): This lab introduces [FPGAs]() using the Diligent Nexus 3 FPGA and the Xilinx ISE IDE.  
  - [LabVIEW Examples](https://github.com/bcomnes/labview-tutorials): A collection of common design patterns in LabVIEW that I found myself needing to reference when teaching others. 

## [Gravity Research]()
- Interferometer
- Capacitive Sensing
- Instrumentation
- Data collection Software
    
  
## [Senior Labs]()

## [445nm Lasers]()

## [Arduino Microserver]()

## [Surly Longhaul Trucker]()
