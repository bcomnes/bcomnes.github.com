Projects
===========

* ##[SEMTerface]() 
    - I'm putting a Scanning Electron Microscope onto the internet using [websockets](), [WebRTC]() and [node]() for great good and a masters degree in applied physics.

* ##[This website]()
    - I decided to dive into some web development a while ago, can came up with this hip [jekyll]()/[bootstrap]() website with the addition of some free time.
    - Halfway into the project, I attended [Indiewebcamp Portland 2013]() and began integrating indieweb technologies into this site such as:
        * [Microformats 2]()
        * [Webmentions]()
        * [IndieAuth]()
    - It has been a great way to learn about Web stuffs, but Jekyll does things in ways I am getting tired of, and designing around these restrictions isn't something I want to do right now.

* ##[Webmention.js]()

* ##[The next version of this website]()
    - While working on [SEMTerface](), I started playing with [Express]() and decided to try my hand at creating a dynamic version of this site using node.  It will go live when it can do most of what the jekyll site can do.
