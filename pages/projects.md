Projects
===========

Here are some projects that might be interesting to others.

##[SEMterface (2013 - Present)](/pages/projects/semterface) 
* I'm putting a Scanning Electron Microscope onto the internet using [websockets](http://socket.io), [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) and [node (express)](http://expressjs.com) for great good and a masters degree in applied physics. 

##[This website (2012 - Present)]()
* I decided to dive into some web development a while ago and part of that effort resulted in this hip [jekyll]()/[bootstrap]() website you are looking at.  It also powers my [PSU TA website]().
* Halfway into the project, I attended [Indiewebcamp Portland 2013]() and began integrating indieweb technologies into this site such as:
  - [Microformats 2]()
  - [Webmentions]()
  - [IndieAuth]()
* It has been a great way to learn about Web stuffs, but Jekyll does things in ways I am getting tired of, and designing around these restrictions isn't something I want to do right now.

##[The next version of this website (2013 - Present)]()
- While working on SEMTerface, I started playing with [Express]() and decided to try my hand at creating a dynamic version of this site using node.  It will go live when it can do most of what the jekyll site can do.

##[Webmention.js (2013)]()
* This small clientside javascript library makes it easy to display webmention data from the [webmention.io]() service.

##[Homework Template (2012 - 2013)]()
* This is the homework template I used when typing up homework in grad school.  It has a collection of useful packages that make typing out solutions to graduate level physics homework a bit easier.  There are some issues, but it works well in most cases.

## [Physics Homework]()
* I typed up some of my quantum mechanics homework.  It ended up taking a few extra hours per assignment, but the results were much nicer than writing the solutions by hand.  Some of the solutions are incorrect as I didn't have time to make corrections after they were graded.  It was a great way to gain fluency in LaTeX.

## [Mathematica Notebooks]()
* [Ising Model]():
* [Hydrogen Atom Energy Levels](): 
* [Where's Waldo]():
* [Tricky E&M Integrals]():
* [Fun Calculus Problems]():

## [Resume]()
* My resume typeset in LaTeX and versioned with git.

## [Introductory Physics Labs]()
* I wrote two labs for an introductory electronics class at Portland State University.
  - [Microcontroller Lab](): This lab introduces students to microcontrollers by walking them through a variety of activities using the Arduino Microcontroller.  It also includes a small section on use of the [PID]() Arduino library.  
  - [FPGA Lab](): This lab introduces [FPGAs]() using the Diligent Nexus 3 FPGA and the Xilinx ISE IDE.  
  - [LabVIEW Examples](https://github.com/bcomnes/labview-tutorials): A collection of common design patterns in LabVIEW that I found myself needing to reference when teaching others. 

## [Gravity Research]()
- Interferometer
- Capacitive Sensing
- Instrumentation
- Data collection Software

## [445nm Lasers]()

## [Surly Longhaul Trucker]()
