~~This is my website.  It it builds in jekyll safemode when jekyll isnt broken.~~

This website is wicked broken.  Thats because its built with Jekyll, which despite being a static website generator, always somehow manages to be broken.  This is a good lesson on why you shouldn't use a CEOs pet cms project, or anything more complicated than you care to understand.

Please see https://github.com/bcomnes/bret.io for an updated approach to a simple personal website.
