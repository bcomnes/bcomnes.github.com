==================

My webpage.  Its being worked on.  I don't know HTML or CSS, so hopefully by the end of this I will know a little more.

### A little about me ###

I graduated in 2011 with a B.S. in Physics from Humboldt State University where I helped study gravity. I currently live in Portland, OR where I am working on my PhD in Physics at Portland State University.

This is a website that I would *like* to post the results of projects and experiments to, as well as random thoughts, but I still need to figure all that out.
