This is my attempted at a personal website.  It's not done, as it turns out making your own web page from scratch takes a lot of work.

More recent work has gone to implementing [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com) features.

Currently working on integrating gitpub.  Its also due for a major refactor to clean things up and removed not so successful experiments
