Bret Comnes's Website
==================

This is my webpage.  It's being worked on.  I don't know HTML or CSS, so hopefully by the end of this I will know a little more.

### About the website ###

The goal here is to create a static website using tools that would make it easy to update.  I have decided on using Jekyll, for the site generation, and Twitter bootstrap for the HTML/CSS/Framework features.  

I chose Jekyll because of the free web-hosting offered by Github, and because it seemed to be well supported by a large community.  Twitter bootstrap also has a large community, and offers more than I would ever need in a website.  The large community is important because it typically means there is a lot of discussion about how to use the tools.  As someone not knowing much of anything about making a website, this is important.

### Technology goals ###

I wanted the requirements to update the website to be simple.  Something like a text editor, and the transfer mechanism to the host.  I didn't want to rely on an additional 3rd party web-app, for example, to upload new pages or make edits.  Github pages will run a very basic Jekyll generation routine, so a text editor and a working instance of git is all you need to make minor edits.

Basically, I want to have the ability to update my site relatively painlessly from a shell account I am logging into the first time.
