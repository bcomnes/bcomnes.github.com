Bret Comnes's Website
==================

This is my attempted at a personal website.  It's made wit Jekyll to take advantage of the free web hosting offered by Github.  My goal is to wire up clean semantic and valid HTML output to Bootstrap.  So far its working, but I would like to avoid using stylistic HTML classes like Bootstrap encourages, and eventually use a custom build of bootstrap.  Right now I opted for the stylistic classes just to get something to work.  I also need to work on the schematic side of things.

## Minimal Requirements goal

The other goal I have is that all that would be required to update the website would be git and a text editor or just Github's built in editor.  Obviously for local previews, a working Jekyll environment is required, but that is only needed for the initial site setup.  This way, the barrier to posting is drastically lowered.

## Longterm

Long term goals for the site is separating the site layout into a skeleton framework, and implement DRY style includes.
