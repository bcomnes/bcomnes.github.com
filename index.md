<h1>Bret Comnes</h1>
I graduated in 2011 with a B.S. in [Physics](http://www.humboldt.edu/physics/) from [Humboldt State University](http://www.humboldt.edu/) where I helped study [gravity](http://www.humboldt.edu/physics/gravitational-lab.html).  I currently live in [Portland, OR](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Portland+OR&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&hl=en) where I am a Graduate Student at the Portland State University Physics doctoral program.
