Really cool work Aaron!  I'm currently working on something similar myself, but It's taking a long time for all the pieces to properly fall into place:

- [Base](https://github.com/bcomnes/base) (WIP): A base webmention/mircopub friendly jekyll boilerplate.
- [Gitpub](https://github.com/bcomnes/gitpub) (Prototype): A micropub/POSSE/Webmention endpoint.
