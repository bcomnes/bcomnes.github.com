A neat stack overflow question about finding Waldo programmatically came up recently, and a user named Heike came up with a [pretty interesting solution using Mathematica.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8479058/how-do-i-find-waldo-with-mathematica/8479757#8479757)

For those who don't have a Mathematica license, I threw together a [.CDF](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/) version of the code, and added some variables to play around with.  The code does not work on every picture, probably due to poor image resolution, but you can get a better idea how the code works nonetheless.  Have a look:
