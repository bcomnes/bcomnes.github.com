This past weekend I attended [IndieWebCamp 2013](http://indiewebcamp.com/Main_Page), a small, two day [barcamp](http://barcampportland.org/about/) style conference in [Portland, OR](http://goo.gl/maps/okB7X).  I have never been to anything like this before, but needless to say, given all of the [amazing ideas and fantastic projects people](http://tantek.com/2013/175/t2/indiewebcamp-hacks-sms-login-webfist-favoriting) left with, I had a fantastic time and left inspired.

# Projects that blew my mind
Every project at IWC2013 was interesting and important in its own way. They are the product of everyone scratching their own itch, [doing things their own way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFyh8ihzEs), finding [common](http://microformats.org/) [ground](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/) with others and ultimately avoiding [monoculture](http://indiewebcamp.com/monoculture).  That being said, the following projects really blew my mind.

## [Webfist](http://webfist.org/)

What happens when you have two incredibly skilled Google engineers sit down for a day and hack on the solution to corporations who are too stubborn to adopt open web technologies?  

#### The answer to that is [Webfist](http://webfist.org/).

Developed by [Brett Slatkin](http://www.onebigfluke.com/) and [Brad Fitzpatrick](http://bradfitz.com/), Webfist is the the answer to the slow rate at which [Webfinger](http://webfinger.org/) is being implemented by basically everyone.

#### Here are the details I remember from the weekend.

Webfinger lets you attach arbitrary information such as a profile photo URL, a public encryption key, website URL, or preferred authentication provider to you email address, allowing for anyone to discover this information from just your email address and some simple http requests.

The problem with Webfinger is that the email provider has to implement it in order for it to work, and so far nobody has done this.

Webfist is the software used to run a distributed fallback network that allows webfinger attributes to be associated with *any* email address, even if the email provider has not yet implemented Webfinger support.  [The way it actually works is kind of complicated](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/06/bootstrapping-webfinger-with-webfist.html), but it uses some kind of fancy cryptographic header information to allow an email address' to associate Webfinger data with itself securely.  

#### How can I start using it today?

After speaking with Brad, it sounds like it wont be necessary for many individuals to run a Webfist server, although its completely possible for anyone to run a node in the distributed network.  It sounds like the developers have a number of connections that can provide the necessary infrastructure to get the network off the ground.

I still have not found a clear example showing exactly how to get data into the Webfist network, but will repost it here when I find it.

#### What about the whole own your domain thing?

There was [some objection to Webfinger](http://indiewebcamp.com/WebFinger) during the discussion session on Webfist.  It's not hard to see Webfinger as a perpendicular direction to many efforts of [IndieWebCamp](http://indiewebcamp.com/why) which strongly advocates the use of a domain to identify yourself on the web.  On the flip side of this concern, it could enable transitional mechanisms via Webfingers powerful discoverability abilities that could allow people without a domain yet to participate on the IndieWeb in a larger way than without it.

The applications of Webfinger goes beyond identity on the web however, as it basically provides a solution to the public key discovery problem which could actually allow PGP to be used more easily.  And now we have Webfist to help get this ball rolling.

Oh, and I can't confirm or deny if [webfist.me](webfist.me) was purchased over the weekend.


## Passwordless Authentication and Persona

[IndiAuth](https://indieauth.com/) received two major features over the weekend.  I had been hoping that [Persona](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) would be added as an authentication provider since I found out about the project a few months ago.  Luckily [Austin King](http://ozten.com/psto/) and [Francois Marier](http://fmarier.org/), both Mozilla Developers, as well as as [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com/) were able to make this happen.

#### IndiAuth now supports Persona when provided an email address.

Mozilla Persona [brings a lot of benefits](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/46374271364/persona-is-distributed-today) over some of the standard authentication providers.  One of those benefits is that IndiAuth can be used as an auth provider for Persona, so the relationship can work both ways, although this part has not actually been implemented yet.  

#### SMS Authentication kills the password

[Aaron](http://aaronparecki.com/) implemented SMS authentication in IndieAuth.  If you add
