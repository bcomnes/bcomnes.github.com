It isn't uncommon to come across unix software that **does not** conform to the standard unix directory structure:

{% highlight sh %}
/bin
/include
/lib
/lib64
/local
/sbin
/share
/tmp
{% endhighlight %}

When you are using a system like [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), this non-conformity can be a real pain in the neck since it tends to result in a royal mess in `/usr/local` or `~/` or wherever you are stowing.

### Turn that Stow Ignore File into an Include File

`stow` allows you to throw a `.stow-local-ignore` into (program | dotfiles | config | whatever) folders inside your stow folder.  These ignore files use perl regular expressions, one per line, that cause `stow` to ignore files and folders than at least one regex selects, with no way to more specifically negate a less specific regular expression (like you can in `.gitignore` files).

The following regular expressions ignores all folders/files that are not apart of the standard unix directory structure:

{% highlight perl %}
/^((?!(\/)bin|include|lib|lib64|local|sbin|share|tmp).)*$/
{% endhighlight %}

The double `//` is implied each line in the ignore file so just omit those in the actual `.stow-local-ignore` file:

{% highlight perl %}
# Only stow the following folders
^((?!(\/)bin|include|lib|lib64|local|sbin|share|tmp).)*$
{% endhighlight %}

This can be super handy for throwing into a messy binary distribution of a program to avoid stowing `README` and `INSTALL` files, or even worse, when a program `make install`'s a bunch of extra unneeded crap into your `stow/program-x.x.x` folder.  Its also a simple syntax to extend and modify to your needs.

This can also be used in a `~/.stow-global-ignore` file, but it might be too aggressive in some situations.  Take it case by case.

### Test your ignore/include file

You can test the ignore file using a dry run in verbose mode:

{% highlight sh %}
~ > cd stow
stow > stow -S -v -n program-x.x.x
# Stow will print a list of files that it will stow without the -n flag
{% endhighlight %}

### How does this work?

Negating regular expressions is somewhat non-trivial, but we can use a clever trick called "negative look-arounds".  It works by using a regular expression that selects everything that does not contain the substring we select in the `(?!string)` selector.  You can read more about this trick on this excellent stack overflow answer:

### Why use ignore/include files?

Stow includes a number of options for customizing the stow process, but they must be specified at the time of stowing, which makes stow more difficult and finicky to use because a stow process that specifies additional options can't be trivially reproduced at a later time unless careful documentation is kept.  Its better to specify how you want the program stowed each and every time so that the stow process is always idempotent:

{% highlight sh %}
~ > cd stow
stow > stow -S program-x.x.x
# program is now stowed
stow > stow -D program-x.x.x
# program is now unstowed
# The stow process should never be different than this
{% endhighlight %}
