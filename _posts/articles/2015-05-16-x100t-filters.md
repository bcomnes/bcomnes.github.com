Here is a lens filter setup that is compatible with the [Fujifilm LC-X100S](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/accessories/camera_cases/#case) leather case used with a [X100T](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x100t/):

The stack fits in the case almost perfectly.

It fits under the case and doesn't increase the difficulty of removing the top cover.

It consists of:

- The default thread cover ring that comes on the camera.

The Fujifilm [AR-X100](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/accessories/lens/#lenshood) Adapter Ring can be avoided all together if you put the lens filter and spacer ring on __backwards__.  In addition to fitting in the case better, a bonus to this arrangement is that you get to keep using the little thread cover ring that comes on the camera.

__Important__: You have to use a spacer.  The lens on the X100T extends out of the barrel quite a few *mm*, and you could damage the motor without enough space between the filter and the lens.

The only drawback is that the lens cap that comes with the camera fit any longer.  Thats okay though because your top case is now the lens cap, and your primary lens is no longer vulnerable when the top cover is off.
