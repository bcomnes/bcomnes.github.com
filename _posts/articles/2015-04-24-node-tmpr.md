New `npm` module:

[`tmpr`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmpr) ([repo](https://github.com/bcomnes/node-tmpr))

![demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/bcomnes/node-tmpr/f871976d5f391b772573d36d1cbafe8fbe6cb4be/tmpr.gif)

There are [quite a few temp dir libraries out there](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=tmpdir), and most of them are super overkill: keeping track of state, offering sub-par cleanup options in some cases and generally offering more than is needed at any single point.  After asking around in `#pdxnode`, [`ogd`](http://maxogden.com/) pointed out this seemingly obvious pattern:

{% highlight js %}
mkdirp(path.join(os.tmpdir() + crypto.randomBytes()), cb)
{% endhighlight %}

Anyway, this approach still requires a bit of boilerplate and knowledge of standard libs so wrapping it up in a module can abstract those details away and offer a super simple abstraction to a common problem!
