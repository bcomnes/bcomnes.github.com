[Klint Finley](https://twitter.com/klintron) published his article about [IWC2013](http://indiewebcamp.com/2013) today.  It's well written, insightful and captures what went on that weekend.  Some [corrections have been noted](http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?diff=4475&oldid=4474&rcid=4549) and its advisable to avoid reading the disqus comments if you want to retain your sanity.
