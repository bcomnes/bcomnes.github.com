I can't believe I missed this.  RSS feeds, in general, have been declining in quality for a long time now due to many websites thinking that they are *so* important, that I *must* link through to see their articles.  This tool takes a low quality RSS feed (one that truncates feeds or adds in comments and share buttons) and cleans it up to a nice clean, full text RSS feed.  

The only problem is that if this service moves or gets shut down you will have to find a way to update quite a few feeds to a replacement service, if there is one. 

Personally, I wish that RSS readers would have the ability to sort this out locally, but all solutions I have seen rely on something like [Readability](http://readability.com/developers/api) or act like a proxy such as this solution.
