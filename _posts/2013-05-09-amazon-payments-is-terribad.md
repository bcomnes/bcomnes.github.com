A month or so ago, I deiced to pay for a [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com) account to play around with some of the pro features longer than the trial allowed.  I decided to use [Amazon Payments](https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/index.htm), thinking that it would be linked to my Amazon account and ready to rock, and to see what some of the Paypal alternatives were like.  

This was a total mistake, and apparently its totally a separate thing from you Amazon account!  Way to take advantage of perceived connivence.

A month later my Alpha subscription renewed after forgetting about it, and I decided it was time to end the subscription.  With the assumption Amazon simply wouldn't allow for merchants to charge my account whenever they wanted, I went over to Amazon payments to cancel the subscription, assuming it worked similar to PayPal since it's basically a clone of that service. 

Arriving at the site, I found a completely confusing and unfamiliar interface, and absolutely no information about subscriptions.  So I called customer service:

"Hi a subscription just renewed and charged my AP account, please cancel the subscription."

"Sorry, there are no subscriptions, you should be good."

"But WA just auto charged the account, what about that?"

"That was a one time payment, not a subscription."

"So it wont be charged next month?"

"Thats right".

I guess they were referencing one of those one time payments you have to pay monthly.  Realizing the person on the phone was going to pretend that the issue didn't exist, I gave up and headed over to the WA website and found a way to cancel the subscription, no thanks to the AP rep.  

Simultaneous to all of this, AP started throwing up Javascript popups all over the screen about needing SSNs and address information, which, not surprisingly, they didn't need for me to start using the account.  So after getting super annoyed when searching for the subscription services in the wrong place, I gave in and provided the needed info.  

A few days later I started getting emails about verifying more tax info, at which point I gave up.  I finally received a account locking notification a few days later.  Great, whatever.

A month or so later, I decided to throw some money towards my [sisters kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/253015204/how-the-moon-made-me-making-the-music-video?ref=live) and it turns out Amazon forces you to use AP unsurprisingly.  

Back on the phone, round 2!

"Hi, I want to unlock my account"

"Blah blah blah, 2-5 days wait, you will get an email"

"2-5 days huh?  This totally sucks, fine."

I get an email back saying "How did we do?"  Of course I tell them awful!  Everything about the service has been a huge waste of time, at which the webapp decided their service reps should give me a second go and asked if it could call me back.  Sure.  Fine.

"Hi, I see you talked to us already, sorry"

"Yeah this is pathetic really, here is a brief summary of what is written above, you see I'm not necessary set on having an AP account, especially if its this huge hassle and requires information I'm not confident in divulging yet, even though I already did."

"Sorry, just wait 2-5 days, taxes, irs"

"You didn't need it before I logged in, and at this point I'm ready to give AP up completely"

"Ill let the person who might contact you in 2-5 days know you talked to us, just wait 2-5 days"

"That's okay, just close the account today, I wouldn't want to waste the persons time in 2-5 days, I'm literally never going to use this ever again".

"Wait 2-5 days, and we can close the account".

So there you have it, Amazon Payments is a humongous waste of time.
