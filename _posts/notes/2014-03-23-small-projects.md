_Just some notes from the past couple days_

Trying to focus on smaller, more immediately useful projects lately.  A few ideas on the table:

- Atom feed for the [IWC IRC](http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today) Logs
	* It would be nice to track these logs through a feed reader.
    * The are marked up with µF2, so working with them is easy.
    * This project could set the stage for a more generalized tool.
    * Demonstrate the µF2 community's commitment to supporting RSS/Atom feeds.
- Simple GH-Pages Blog Posting Interface
	* [Prose](http://prose.io) is great, but development is too slow, and lacks many basic features and isnt mobile friendly.  
    * This could take the form of a [Micropub](http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub) endpoint.  This is dependant on the existance of posting interfaces though.
    * The main goal is to lower the barrier to posting.  Git+Jekyll is great for offline, but easy/post from anywhere is more desireable at this point.
 
 A few other ideas rattling around:
 
- [Camlistore](https://camlistore.org) - Should know more after the [meet up](http://calagator.org/events/1250465835).  The [new demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBCQq5hfsug) is great.
- [Poet](http://jsantell.github.io/poet/) - After [sinking some time](https://github.com/bcomnes/bretzel) into recreating Jekyll in node, poet looks appealing, despite the dependance on Express.
