- Getting a working Go environment takes a while
- Building camlistore is pretty easy
- Your GPG identity needs to be consistent between the client and server
- Added #camlistore IRC info to the docs: [https://camlistore-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2696/](https://camlistore-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2696/)

Also, as a bonus, we found out that running the [smallest federated wiki](http://wardcunningham.github.io/) is pretty much the [easiest thing ever](http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-04-27/line/1398626962):

```sh
$ npm install -g wiki
wiki //starts on localhost:3000
```
