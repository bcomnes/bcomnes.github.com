Dave:

I attended IWC 2013 and have helped out with a few of the bi-weekly meetups due to my locality and interest in their driving principals. I have also been an enthusiastic follower of your writing and your work on fargo/opml.

I would be really bummed to see you write off a much larger group of individuals actively developing and exploring their own piece of the independent web based off the criticisms on RSS/Atom sourced from a few vocal community members.

As with any spec or technology, anyone can lay out issues or weaknesses about them, as has been done with RSS/Atom on the IWC wiki. I like what you said though: "Until then, we use what works -- for us." And that is what I see coming from the IWC community.

I don't think anybody is advocating for an RSS-less web. In fact, everyone I have met in the IWC actively publishes rss/atom feeds (remember, action > words).

But RSS never lived up to its full vision and is in a super sad state. While the rest of the world signed up for Facebook and twitter which effectively turned these into the status quo 'news reader' for most people, RSS and atom bickered and hardened their way into its current sorry state. Between market stagnation due to google reader, browser vendors giving up and removing discovery features, facebook and twitter pushing rss feeds into obscurity/oblivion and the general hearsay decline of feed quality, RSS feeds really have a lot of ground to regain. Those who saw the light of feeds love it and defend it (thats me!). Those who never figured it out moved on. Even the resurgence of readers after the big google reader shutdown have really aimed to clone that old experience.

Core to to the indieweb community are the principals: [do what you can to]: Own your data, build for yourself first, focus on UX and design over protocols/formats.

These are the ideas that, as far as I can tell, bring people together to actually build the web they want to see, rather than wait for it to happen. As far as I can tell, these are the kinds of principals that are consistent with, if fully aligned with, your work on fargo. With this, I say: Same team!

A healthy community is diverse, and your manifesto is definitely a shared vision of individuals involved with the IW community (just look at the mixed content feeds of http://waterpigs.co.uk/ or http://werd.io/ !)

Communities can be tribes, I know this, but lets not knock each other over the details. As far as I can tell, everyone is moving in the same direction here.

Side note: Microformats2 happen to be the protocol used in the cross-site commenting experiments that some people are working on. If it was a fashion statement however, an alternate JSON representation of a page served by the webserver would be the preferred format today, right? (maybe just with hipsterdev) But it would be just as valid as an RSS 'feed' of a sigle post? Again, the idea in this experiment is to push things forward, and improve feeds beyond a list of different post types.
