## Notes from WebRTC Camp 2013

- [Hackpad with notes and schedule](https://hackpad.com/WebRTC-Camp-2013-ViBwUIBkDGh)
- [#webrtcamp on freenode](irc://chat.us.freenode.net/webrtcamp)
- Why [SDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol)?  
	- WebRTC has deepish roots with Jingle (it sounds?)
	- SDP originate with [MBone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbone)
- The WebRTC stack only uses the VP8 video codec right now, however it sounds like there is a lack of hardware support for VP8, however Google is working on getting those in production.  It is unknown what Apple will do, and Microsoft has their own competing proticol.  
- Screen sharing has all sorts of security issues, namely, once you can see someone elses screen, you can pull sensative information off of their screen, such as auth tokens etc.
- It is possible to implement whatever you want over data channel, including your own voice and video tools.  This is a huge project, "orders of magnitude" larger than a standard web application.
