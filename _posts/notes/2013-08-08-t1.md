Please divert your attention to a great post by [Shane Becker](http://iamshane.com/):
- [JSON-LD is an Unneeded Spec](http://iamshane.com/articles/2013/8/8/1/json-ld-is-an-uneeded-spec)
It isn't that JSON-LD, and its efforts to standardize a JSON vocabulary, lacks valuable motivation or isn't trying to solve a real problem, it's that it is a redundant effort that is making a lot of the same mistakes of standards past, on top of a number of questionable licensing issues.  In the context of the web, its a complete DRY violation which brings along all of the data rot and maintenance problems that RSS and ATOM suffer from.  

I was bummed to hear that [Payswarm](https://payswarm.com) is behind it, as they are trying to tackle an important issue.
