Finally, the [LaTeX-Font-Settings.tmbundle](LaTeX-Font-Settings.tmbundle/) has been updated to include all seven section scopes, so 1.0 it is.

Some things to come in the future:

- Keep increasing the scope slectors
- Default resizing for `\begin{}` tags.
- Blank selectors on other items people might want but innapropriate for default modificaiton.
- Documentation on how to identify existing selectors or create your own selectors.
