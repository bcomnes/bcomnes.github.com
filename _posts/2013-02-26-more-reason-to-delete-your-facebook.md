I never got around to writing about the reasons I deleted (not just deactivating) my Facebook account more than a year ago.  Sure, it was helpful for keeping in contact with people who can't keep track of a single email address for an extended number of years, but it began to act as the anti-social network for those close and active in my life.  Initiating social engagements increasingly relied on this corporate network, and it provided the illusion of communication, when really it only acted as a black hole for our thoughts and experiences.  I might still get around to writing about why, but for now, this article nails a lot of wonderful, more recent ways Facebook totally sucks and why you should also delete your account.  

Additionally, here are some pretty fantastic talks given by Eben Moglen only providing more support for the position of dumping the power of the book.
